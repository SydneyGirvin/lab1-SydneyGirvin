## Load Packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

library(viridis)
```

## Exercise 1

(Type your answer to Exercise 1 here. Add code chunks as needed. Don't forget to label your code chunk. Do not use spaces in code chunk labels.)

```{r ex-1}
ggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000)
```
The data is greatly skewed to the right. There appears to be outliers between 50000 and 75000 as well as after 75000. 

## Exercise 2

```{r ex-2}
ggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = percollege, y = percbelowpoverty, color = state)) +  
     geom_point() +
        scale_color_viridis_d()
```
